Future plans:
prevent ignored commodity prices from skyrocketing
add multiple save slots
allow attrition resistance even when buildings are damaged
Maybe cause health attrition when moving
Change the remove crew button to use the vehicles.eject_crew function and add a button using the eject_passengers function as an opposite of the 'z' button
Possibly ministers should still be involved but without corruption when there is no profit to be gained, such as in defensive combat or when avoiding health attrition
Maybe allow ship's crew to leave while cargo is on board but cargo is lost at end of turn if not replaced
possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
possibly display a notification when a unit dies and have an optional cause of death parameter

Known Errors:
building icon issue most likely from building's default image_id being based on the one it had when saving rather than what it had on creation
incorrect building inventory capacity when buildings are damaged on load
building icon not updating correctly on repair
make sure that construction gang can not construct copy of damaged building
native warriors name attribute unnecessarily capitalized
work crews should be removed from building when it is damaged
make sure upgrading roads/railroads works correctly with damage - road that has been upgraded to railroad should use the damaged_railroad image
Make sure to test expedition exploring tile with native warriors - untested and unusual interaction. Should explore but remain in starting tile, go in and return without taking damage, still exploring nearby water
Make sure worker changed to workers in text descriptions throughout the program
incorrect spacing on generate article when blank output is returned
