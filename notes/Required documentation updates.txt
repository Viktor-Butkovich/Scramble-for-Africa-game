Future plans:
Maybe cause health attrition when moving
Cause inventory attrition when moving, not just when standing still
Change the remove crew button to use the vehicles.eject_crew function and add a button using the eject_passengers function as an opposite of the 'z' button
Possibly ministers should still be involved but without corruption when there is no profit to be gained, such as in defensive combat or when avoiding health attrition
Maybe allow ship's crew to leave while cargo is on board but cargo is lost at end of turn if not replaced
Add chance of commodity loss on movement
Chance of commodity attrition for a unit carrying commodities, higher chance if more being held, lose a certain amount at a time
add actor_utility.find_closest_available_worker and fix worker.replace
Make group worker, attached work crew, and passenger replacement work
possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
battalion should get off of vehicle when combat starts, maybe with disorganized penalty
improve health attrition, add commodity attrition w/ corruption
possibly display a notification when a unit dies and have an optional cause of death parameter
Enemies should attack buildings and attached work crews

Known Errors:
building worker labels not displaying in current save game, maybe issue with detecting resource building or with work crew/worker distinction
images.update_roads interaction may not work with new building damage system
When attrition on movement is added, ensure that movement is not possible while transportation minister is not appointed

Check maximum inventory capacity on resource production building - should be 9 but is 18 under certain circumstances. 
Seems to occur after loading a game, perhaps inventory capacity is saved incorrectly

Make sure worker changed to workers in text descriptions throughout the program
incorrect spacing on generate article when blank output is returned
