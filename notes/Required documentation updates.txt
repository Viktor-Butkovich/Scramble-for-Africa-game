Future plans:
add corruption during trials
confiscate % of money from minister losing trial
possibly have adjustable police investment per turn
add flavor text for police informants, investigations, etc instead of prosecutor finding it
add notification and public opinion penalty to actor_display_tools/buttons.remove_minister_button
change action failed messages to reference minister asking for more time/money rather than the unit officer
prevent ignored commodity prices from skyrocketing
add multiple save slots
allow attrition resistance even when buildings are damaged
Maybe cause health attrition when moving
Change the remove crew button to use the vehicles.eject_crew function and add a button using the eject_passengers function as an opposite of the 'z' button
Possibly ministers should still be involved but without corruption when there is no profit to be gained, such as in defensive combat or when avoiding health attrition
Maybe allow ship's crew to leave while cargo is on board but cargo is lost at end of turn if not replaced
possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
possibly display a notification when a unit dies and have an optional cause of death parameter

Possible/known Errors:
prevent multiple trials from happening in the same turn
pmobs.display_die creating minister icons without resolution scaling
native warriors name attribute unnecessarily capitalized
damaging a building should remove its work crews, even if no enemies are present
Make sure to test expedition exploring tile with native warriors - untested and unusual interaction. Should explore but remain in starting tile, go in and return without taking damage, still exploring nearby water
Make sure worker changed to workers in text descriptions throughout the program
