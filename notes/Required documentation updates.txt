Future plans:
Make group worker, attached work crew, and passenger replacement work
possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
battalion should get off of vehicle when combat starts, maybe with disorganized penalty
improve health attrition, add commodity attrition w/ corruption
possibly display a notification when a unit dies and have an optional cause of death parameter
Enemies should attack buildings and attached work crews

Errors:
If a vehicle's crew is detached, it should retain its inventory but have its inventory size reduced to 0 and remove its inventory at the end of the next turn
Check maximum inventory capacity on resource production building - should be 9, 18 on current save
Change worker -> workers in text descriptions throughout the program
