Future plans:
possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
battalion should get off of vehicle when combat starts, maybe with disorganized penalty
add attrition
possibly display a notification when a unit dies and have an optional cause of death parameter
Enemies should attack buildings and attached work crews

Errors:
If a vehicle's crew is detached, it should retain its inventory but have its inventory size reduced to 0 and remove its inventory at the end of the next turn
