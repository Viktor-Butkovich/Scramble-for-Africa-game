possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
errors:
able to move through native warriors with non-battalion units
make sure available workers never exceeds population when native warriors leave
battalion should get off of vehicle when combat starts, maybe with disorganized penalty
