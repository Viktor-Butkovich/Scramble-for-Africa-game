Future plans:
Maybe cause health attrition when moving
Cause inventory attrition when moving, not just when standing still
Change the remove crew button to use the vehicles.eject_crew function and add a button using the eject_passengers function as an opposite of the 'z' button
Possibly ministers should still be involved but without corruption when there is no profit to be gained, such as in defensive combat or when avoiding health attrition
Maybe allow ship's crew to leave while cargo is on board but cargo is lost at end of turn if not replaced
Add chance of commodity loss on movement
Chance of commodity attrition for a unit carrying commodities, higher chance if more being held, lose a certain amount at a time
add actor_utility.find_closest_available_worker and fix worker.replace
Make group worker, attached work crew, and passenger replacement work
possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
battalion should get off of vehicle when combat starts, maybe with disorganized penalty
improve health attrition, add commodity attrition w/ corruption
possibly display a notification when a unit dies and have an optional cause of death parameter
Enemies should attack buildings and attached work crews

Known Errors:
work crews should be removed from building when it is damaged
make sure upgrading roads/railroads works correctly with damage - road that has been upgraded to railroad should use the damaged_railroad image
Make sure to test expedition exploring tile with native warriors - untested and unusual interaction. Should explore but remain in starting tile, go in and return without taking damage, still exploring nearby water

images.update_roads interaction might not work with new building damage system

Make sure worker changed to workers in text descriptions throughout the program
