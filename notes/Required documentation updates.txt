Do next: canoes, public opinion from conversion and killing beasts, random effect on public opinion w/ flavor text when you, 
slave catching (4+ success, 1 causes disorganized, independently affects aggressiveness (1 decreases aggressiveness, 4-6 increases), make sure natural 1 on converting/trading damages mission/trading post, not destroyed, 
add sentry mode/end turn for unit buttons

Future plans:
allow moving empty steamboat across land on train
add steamboat/steamship
increase movement cost when embarking/disembarking
reduce number of times current cell is calculated in npmobs.npmob end turn functions
improve appearance of combat modifier text
add evidence decay over time
add canoe to native warriors and expeditions standing in water
add background to multiple units in tile number to improve contrast
possibly have adjustable police investment per turn
add flavor text for police informants, investigations, etc instead of prosecutor finding it
add notification and public opinion penalty to actor_display_tools/buttons.remove_minister_button
change action failed messages to reference minister asking for more time/money rather than the unit officer
prevent ignored commodity prices from skyrocketing
add multiple save slots
Change the remove crew button to use the vehicles.eject_crew function and add a button using the eject_passengers function as an opposite of the 'z' button
Maybe allow ship's crew to leave while cargo is on board but cargo is lost at end of turn if not replaced
possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
possibly display a notification when a unit dies and have an optional cause of death parameter

Country bonuses: English merchant gets bonus on advertising, German major gets bonus against natives, Belgian major gets bonus on catching slaves, French evangelist gets bonus on converting

Possible/known Errors:
make build riverboat and train different buttons
make sure defending minister or lack thereof is shown in pmobs line 556, not all units use minister for defense
make sure most actions cost remaining movement points instead of maximum
minister face being shown twice during fort construction
should never move camera to invisible enemy during enemy turn
allow player to exit game and save even when ministers are not appointed
capitalize first letter of enemy name during combat
prevent multiple trials from happening in the same turn
pmobs.display_die creating minister icons without resolution scaling
native warriors name attribute unnecessarily capitalized
damaging a building should remove its work crews, even if no enemies are present
Make sure to test expedition exploring tile with native warriors - untested and unusual interaction. Should explore but remain in starting tile, go in and return without taking damage, still exploring nearby water
Make sure worker changed to workers in text descriptions throughout the program
