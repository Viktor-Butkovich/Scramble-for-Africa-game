possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
errors: combats after the first seem to occur after the player's turn starts
combat strength label not updating correctly on group creation
able to move through native warriors with non-battalion units
make sure available workers never exceeds population when native warriors leave
battalion should get off of vehicle when combat starts, maybe with disorganized penalty
