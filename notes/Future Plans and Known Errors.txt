Completed:
slums label appearing in middle of resource production facility labels
steamboat shouldn't show travel button
combat strength of crewed vehicles should be same as workers, not 0
cost of Europe campaigns should double for each time done that turn

add automatic movement routes
control which tiles trains can use in automatic routes
clear movement route when pressing movement button or going to other grid
only allow European workers to crew steamships, no slaves crewing vehicles

Future plans:

Later:
make commodities lost message both a zoom and minister message notification?
Ministers should maybe give public opinion refund for reappointing to same position within the same turn, make sure no exploits possible
autosave on game creation if no save game present, add delete save game button that prevents loading
move construction and repair functions to groups rather than pmobs
don't select units as they move if doing automated route
add automated trade routes
add mode like sentry to not replace attrition losses for a certain unit

^ has categories like archaeology, paleontology, zoology, botany, anthropology (modern), theological (prester john)
^ objectives could appear in explored or unexplored tiles, not ocean, do investigation campaign on objective to see if it is there, random missions from geographic society, chance of one each turn
have chance of explorer promotion on automatic exploration
improve terrain appearances, especially hills
improve button images for labor broker, switch screens, etc.
add bridges
if no save file present, autosave on game creation
Country bonuses: English merchant gets bonus on advertising, German major gets bonus against natives, Belgian major gets bonus on catching slaves, French evangelist gets bonus on converting
change action failed messages to reference minister asking for more time/money rather than the unit officer

add flavor text for police informants, investigations, etc instead of prosecutor finding it
make movement buttons more visible/closer to other action buttons, maybe next to fire button
expand buttons where possible across the board
Reduce number of commodities that can be shown at once in inventory and maybe move inventory display farther right to reduce overlapping
Maybe only show inventory capacity on units with inventory capacity or tiles that have inventory capacity or are carrying goods that will be lost at end of turn
Add slave trade suppression, gain progress over time for large public opinion bonus and maybe spawns free African workers
maybe have selected unit blink like in other games to make it more clear that it is selected
improved minister face locations
limit advertising to once per commodity per turn?
upgrade buttons not disappearing correctly upon leaving tile

Possible/known Errors:

Fixable:
incorrect minister face locations on certain resolutions, possibly ones where height is disproportionately large compared to width
fix other resolution issues, expanded text box too high, notification too large/small
update mob info display of selected unit at beginning of turn

Investigating:
incorrect railroad images occasionally occurring when new ones are created, fixed after save and load
infinite loop and phantom officers sometimes created when ship travels to port
check behavior of native warriors spawning when surrounded
safari not correctly having enough movement to follow up after hunting, possibly relating to water
Disorganized flag and tooltip not showing correctly, especially when creating group or after disembarking ship
change check if minister appointed to minister_utility.positions_filled across the board, need prosecutor appointed during other minister's actions, etc.
make sure defending minister or lack thereof is shown in pmobs line 556, not all units use minister for defense
Make sure worker changed to workers in text descriptions throughout the program
incorrect spacing on generate article when blank output is returned
