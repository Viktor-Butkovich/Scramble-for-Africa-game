Future plans:
make commodities lost message both a zoom and minister message notification?
Ministers should maybe give public opinion refund for reappointing to same position within the same turn, make sure no exploits possible
autosave on game creation if no save game present, add delete save game button that prevents loading
don't select units as they move if doing automated route
improve button images for labor broker, switch screens, etc.
change action failed messages to reference minister asking for more time/money rather than the unit officer
add multiple save slots
possible ui improvement: have green/red letters appear by cursor after user does action that grants/requires money
allow moving empty steamboat across land on train
reduce number of times current cell is calculated in npmobs.npmob end turn functions
improve appearance of combat modifier text
add background to multiple units in tile number to improve contrast
possibly have adjustable police investment per turn
add flavor text for police informants, investigations, etc instead of prosecutor finding it
make movement buttons more visible/closer to other action buttons, maybe next to fire button
expand buttons where possible across the board
Reduce number of commodities that can be shown at once in inventory and maybe move inventory display farther right to reduce overlapping
Maybe only show inventory capacity on units with inventory capacity or tiles that have inventory capacity or are carrying goods that will be lost at end of turn
maybe have selected unit blink like in other games to make it more clear that it is selected

Possible/known Errors:
incorrect notification heights on certain resolutions
check behavior of native warriors spawning when surrounded
safari not correctly having enough movement to follow up after hunting, possibly relating to water
