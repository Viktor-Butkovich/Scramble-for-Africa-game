So uncivilized...
What do you need?
How can I help you?
I'm listening
I miss home
Yes?
What is it?
What now?
What can I do for you?
Hmmm...
Sir
Yes sir?
New orders?
Governor?
* Clears throat *
Hello there!
Don't say it again
I heard you
I suppose on that
You better not make me mad
What is our plan?
Ready to serve
You seek my counsel?
Give me one moment
Excellent
Anything you want
Proud to serve
Esteemed governor
We never fail
At your service
God wills it
What's going on?
Ready to help
It's my pleasure
Leave it to me
The empire endures
Do you require my expertise?
What?
It's a pleasure
The pleasure is mine
I remain your most humble and loyal servant
Yes, my lord
I shall get right on it
Good day to you
Say that again?
I can't do it
I'm not gonna!
Well just keep on
I served my country
I thought it was somebody
Hello
Good day
Awaiting orders
Ah, I guess I'm ready
Maybe we can work something out
Let's talk it over
What did you have in mind?
Let's see where this goes
Well, of course
As you wish
It's high tide
Yes, governor?
Let's get them
Uh huh?
I'm listening
Slow down
Ready to serve
More work?
Reporting for duty
I'm so tired

Hired:
For the homeland!
I won't let you down
Superb!
Smart choice
Let's do it
Reporting to duty
You will not regret this
We will accomplish great things
Your confidence is well placed
We will forge an empire together
Forever loyal
I think we have an understanding, you and I
I knew you'd choose me
I'm so honored
Let's get down to business
You won't regret this
Where's my sign on bonus?
I can't wait to see a lion
Let's drink to that!
I will not disappoint

Evidence:
Caught red-handed!
A guilty complexion
I've heard a rumor
Something smells fishy
I'd shoot him if I were you
Despicable
Now I didn't know that
Got him!
We must remove this traitor at once!
What's this?
Look what I found
I found something
We need to talk
Oh, you'll love to hear this
You should see the look on your face
Good news and bad news
Oh, Lord, look what I found
Look what the dog brought back to mommy (?)
Guess what a little birdie told me (?)
Just between us
What a scoundrel
People talk - luckily for us, they talk too much
Word travels, and we listen
When the cat is away, the mice will play
We've uncovered some mischief
Governor, we've got a real problem
How dare you?
This seems very, very suspicious
I need to talk to you - in private
Ah hah!

Fired/Prison:
I will ruin your reputation!
I regret nothing
Please don't...
I was just following orders
This is a grave mistake, sir
Well you little bastard...
You damn dummy!
Well then, I guess it's all over
Who do you think you are?
Bloody hell!
I can't believe this!
Well, I guess I'll be leaving
I swear, this is all just a misunderstanding
No, you can't do this!
You, sir, have made a grave error
I'll see you in hell!
I said I gotta go
Ah, typical
Well, best of luck
All things must end
What in gosh tarnation?
I'll never financially recover from this!
What did I do?
