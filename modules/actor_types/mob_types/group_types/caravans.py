        Description:
            Initializes this object
        Input:
            boolean from_save: True if this object is being recreated from a save file, False if it is being newly created
            dictionary input_dict: Keys corresponding to the values needed to initialize this object
                'coordinates': int tuple value - Two values representing x and y coordinates on one of the game grids
                'grids': grid list value - grids in which this group's images can appear
                'image': string/dictionary/list value - String file path/offset image dictionary/combined list used for this object's image bundle
                    Example of possible image_id: ['mobs/default/button.png', {'image_id': 'mobs/default/default.png', 'size': 0.95, 'x_offset': 0, 'y_offset': 0, 'level': 1}]
                    - Signifies default button image overlayed by a default mob image scaled to 0.95x size
                'name': string value - Required if from save, this group's name
                'modes': string list value - Game modes during which this group's images can appear
                'end_turn_destination': string or int tuple value - Required if from save, 'none' if no saved destination, destination coordinates if saved destination
                'end_turn_destination_grid_type': string value - Required if end_turn_destination is not 'none', matches the status key of the end turn destination grid, allowing loaded object to have that grid as a destination
                'movement_points': int value - Required if from save, how many movement points this actor currently has
                'max_movement_points': int value - Required if from save, maximum number of movement points this mob can have
                'worker': worker or dictionary value - If creating a new group, equals a worker that is part of this group. If loading, equals a dictionary of the saved information necessary to recreate the worker
                'officer': worker or dictionary value - If creating a new group, equals an officer that is part of this group. If loading, equals a dictionary of the saved information necessary to recreate the officer
        Output:
            None
