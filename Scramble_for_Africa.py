# tasks:
#   general (game-agnostic):
# replace usages of 'none' with None
# Add type hints on sight - gradual process
# add minister speech bubbles
# Add random events
# Add debug settings menu within game, rather than needing to edit .json out of game
# Change game to be fullscreen by default, along with debug setting to make it windowed
# Add autosave and multiple save slots
# Performance impacts from repeated exit/load - not everything is being removed each time
# Add ambient sounds
#
# Possible issues:
# Look into special character glitch for Queiros Portuguese name, possibly font issue not having correct special character in the settlement font (but does in minister screen font)
#
#   new SFA features:
